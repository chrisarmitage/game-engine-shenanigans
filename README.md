Warning: Don't expect any sane code here

This is for messing with some algorithm / pattern ideas that could be used in a game, specifically, one I have a vague idea of that I want to make.

## Plan

[ ] A Worker who can perform tasks
[ ] A list of Tasks from different sources with different requirements
[ ] Chaining of Tasks. Eg, I need to do X. To do that, I must first do Y
